                <p class="section_text">Due to our expanding reliance on computer technology, computer science
                    literacy has become just as important as any other core subject
                    taught in schools, and yet it is often overlooked. Just like writing or basic arithmetic,
                    programming is now a fundemental skill every person should have a basic understanding of. Our goal is to
                    fill this vital gap in childhood education with a personalized curriculum for each
                    student to create an engaging learning experience driven by each students invidividual interests.

                <p class="section_text">I'm Miles Grossenbacher, the instructor and co-founder of West Side Tech tutoring.
                    As a former NYU Computer Science
                    student and NYU Teaching Assistant in the Music and Performing Arts department, I have worked with
                    students from a
                    variety of backgrounds at the intersection of Technology and Creativity. My goal as an instructor is to
                    incorporate each
                    students individual passions and curiosities into a personalized curriculum that covers the fundamentals
                    of programming
                    and computer science.
